Amazon: Jeff Bezos. Facebook: Mark Zuckerberg. Google: Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Tesla: Elon Musk. Twitter: Jack Dorsey. Snap: Evan Spiegel. Uber Travis Kalanick. And of course, Apple: Steve Jobs.\n\nSilicon Valley and the tech industry writ large is filled with stories of famous founders, single individuals (mostly white men) whose lives are publicly intertwined with the companies that they founded or co-founded. We know that one person never does anything on their own, but we also know that the actions of one person can have a significant impact on a scene, group, city, nation.\n\n__What does it mean that so many of these companies are strongly identified with individual leaders? More specifically, what purpose does it serve these individuals, their companies, and the users of the platforms and products that they have created?__\n\nYour readings begin with The Great Man Theory, which is composed of a straightforward idea: history is explained by the impact of unique and influential leaders, who are born possessing certain traits of leadership and who arise when our need for them is great. Consider if this idea continues to operate today.\n\n## Response\n\nWhen the (white male) leaders of top tech companies are culturally read through the lens of Thomas Carlyle's Great Man Theory, several consequences emerge:\n\n__It allows for a persona to be attributed to a company and its products/services - perhaps to an exploitative end.__\n\nThe legacy Steve Jobs left on apple is a prime example of this. Steve Job's visible cool, mysterious personality became embedded into both public perception of Apple's company culture and its products. By associating Apple Inc. with the cool personality of its founder, the strong, pervasive imagery of a cool tech culture  (as opposed to \"boring\" tech culture of Linux and Microsoft) allows for the erasure of actual conditions of what it's like to work in technology: \"When it came to business, Mr Jobs was anything but a revolutionary... It seems like a cool, liberal, creative commpanny, but the reality is it's a very locked-down place. It's not a happy place to work\" (Dailey).\n\nOn the consumer-facing side, the alignment of Apple's products with the creative persona of its CEO perhaps exploits consumers optimism through an attraction of creative ideals: \"Everyone who buys a Mac says, 'I'm going to write my novel, I'm going to edit my movie, I'm going to cut that single',\" says Mr Kahney. \"It speaks to that creative streak. In reality all they do is sit around and watch Netflix on it.” (Dailey).\n\n__It allows for the historical erasure of contributions that don't fit into the Great Man Theory.__\n\nCarlisle's Great Man Theory suggests that history can be explained by the exceptional leadership of select great \"men\". Viewing history (and tech culture) through only this lens is myopic, as it erases the contributions of collective and non-male efforts.m\nIn Mary Parker Follet's \"Integrative Process\", a leadership process that encourages a collective, community-centered \"power-with\" attitude rather than an individualist, hierarchical \"power-over\" one, and in Ella Baker's experiences orchestrating impactful, civil rights efforts through uplifting other members in the community, we are shown that an individualist, Great Man theory is not the only way things are challenged. However, we are made to think that it is.\n\nIn the tech world, focusing on the achievements of single individual leader often makes invisible the collective labor of everyone else in the tech echo system. While the leader may show up to make high profile speeches, who are the engineers, designers, managers responsible for keeping things moving? Who are the people, perhaps on the other side of the world, who are responsible for mass production and e-waste of consumer products?\n\nWe might see a focus on the leader working against the leader themselves in some cases. When a company fails or gets caught in the middle of a scandal, the CEO is the one to be scrutinized and blamed.\n\nThere is also the clear emphasis of the \"Great Man\" being necessarily a \"Man\". While many texts in the 1800's assume \"man\" to mean \"human person\", the cultural association of impactful leaders and men is clear through today. Ella Baker's struggles in finding her work as a woman acknowledged within civil rights efforts (in opposition to MLK Jr., who is seen to align with a \"divine right of kings\" leadership that asserted visibility through speeches and dramatic demmonstrations ) speaks to this. \"She was never made official because she was neither a mininstor nor a man.\"\n\n__It reinforces what is valued in a leader, and what kinds of traits make you deserve control.__\n\nCarlisle's point on Great Men as ultimately associated with \"Order\" was interesting to me:\n\n<i>“May we not say, moreover, while so maby of our late Heroes have worked rather as revolutionary men, that nevertheless every Great Man, every genuine man, is by the nature of him a son of Order, not of Disorder?\"</i>\n\nFor my thesis, I have been reading a paper on how gendered dualism emerge in engineering cultures. The paper (by Wendy Faulkner) suggests that engineering involves struggling to achieve control (Order) over things that are unpredictable (Disorder), and the value system of Ordered vs. Disordered is a basis for which other dualisms emerge, like \"Mind vs. Body\" or \"Abstract vs. Concrete\" or \"Theoretical vs. Experimental\".\n\nI think Great Man Theory contributes to this value system, and in the context of computing culture it further privileges what kinds of personality traits are implicitly valued. It is interesting to contrast Great Man Theory's archetypes (divinity, prophet, poet, priest, man of letters, and king) with Baker's concept of leadership (facilitators, coordinators, teacher/educator).\n\n__It contributes to a (complicated) impression of meritocracy?__\n\nMy point on this is not super well formed, but I notice that people often reference these Geniuses as inspiration to elevate them in their own lives. An example of this might be kids wanting to \"be the next Mark Zuckerberg\" or adults who have never gotten a technical education but wish to self-study and get a career in software engineering (a recurring archetype we notice in ed-tech). I think that these leaders offer inspiration because they sometimes come from middle class backgrounds and appear to build entire empires from very little, and that gives other people hope that they too can do similar things. \n\nThis mindset seems to be aligned with a belief that the tech world is a meritocracy: if your chops are good enough then you can also share a slice of that success. This is kind of antithetical to Great Man Theory in actuality, which describes the leader as being born as an exceptional leader. There is some tension between Genius Founders as being elite and god-like and Geninus Founders as being just-like-you, clad in t-shirt and jeans, that I think is able to keep them in power while letting them seem down-to-earth and relatable. (I'm thinking of Mark Zuckerberg's public image, pre-alien memes and Cambridge Analytica).\n\n\n\n## My Questions\n1. To what extent is it true that genius founders can be a source of inspiration and success for other people?\n\n2. Does Great Man Theory get less problematic if the people we view through that lens are more diverse? If we have more \"Great Women\" in tech?\n\n3. How does the idea of genius founder, as something to draw inspiration from, interact with the idea of genius founder, as having been born a unique leader?\n\n\n\n## Readings\n\nDailey, Kate. “The cult of Steve Jobs”.

The physical computing aspect of this project is an internet-of-thing \"pet\" that in some way indicates the \"happiness\" of the pet, affected by its care.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-11 at 11.23.17 PM](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/3kLxa7A2E7zqkn6KxdNsVJ/170cd20241f0d5ec45a50f97428e367d/Screen_Shot_2019-11-11_at_11.23.17_PM.png)\n\n### Details on the REST application\n\nThe REST application will store attributes about the pet's care. These attributes can be interacted with over a client-side web interface.\n\nAttributes of the pet:\n\n__Hunger satisfaction level__\n\n- How satisfied is the pet’s hunger?\n- This level decrements over time.\n- This level starts at 0 and maxes out at 10.\n\n__Love satisfaction level__\n\n- How much love does the pet have?\n- This level decrements over time.\n- This level starts at 0 and maxes out at 10.\n\n__Cleanliness level__\n- How clean is the pet?\n- This level decrements over time.\n- This level starts at 0 and maxes out at 10.\n\nThe attributes tick and decrement at a predetermined time interval, eg every hour.\n\n\n### A physical avatar communicating the state of the simulation\n\nIn addition to the application simulating the pet, the system will include a physical “pet” that can represent the state of the pet’s overall happiness. We define “overall happiness” to be the sum of the hunger, love, and cleanliness levels, out of the total number of 30 points. For example if we have hunger = 4/10, love = 2/10, cleanliness = 9/10, overall happiness will be 15/30.\n\nThe way the physical pet can represent this overall happiness level is up to the builders interpretation. For example, it can be as simple as turning an LED within the pet “on” if the happiness is over a certain threshold, and “off” if it is below that threshold.\n\nThe pet will be making continuous GET requests, at an interval up to the builder’s discretion  to the level of the pet’s overall happiness.\n\nWe also leave open the general physical form of the “pet” to the interpretation of the builders.\n\n### A web client to provide users with an easy way to trigger API calls\n\n(Andrew and I are still a bit confused on the conventions behind RESTFUL API calls and will need to clarify our approach here)\n\nThe web client will first allow users to see the pet's attributes.\n\n<i>HTTP GET /pet</i>\n\n-> return data about the hunger, love, cleanliness, and happiness\n\n\nThe web client will allow users to take care of the pet, by pressing buttons that say \"Feed\", \"Pet\", and \"Clean\". Each of these three buttons will trigger API calls to the REST application and increase the value of fed-ness, loved-ness, and cleanliness, respectively.\n\n__Feed the Pet__\n\n<i>HTTP PUT /pet/bowl -> {foods:1}</i>\n\nWe feed the pet by a unit of 1, which should increase the fed level by 1.\n\n__Pet the Pet__\n\n<i>HTTP PUT /pet/love/ -> {pat:1}</i>\n\n\nWe pat the pet once, which should increase the love level by 1.\n\n__Clean the Poop__\n\n<i>PUT /pet/cleanliness -> {isCleaned: true}</i>\n\nSending the server \"isCleaned: true\" will clean the pet and return it to a full cleanliness level.\n\nAgain, hopefully in class we will clarify if this is the correct approach.","createdAt":"2019-11-12T04:38:16.066Z","tags":[{"name":"Understanding Networks"}]}},{"node":{"id":"1MSh1afeQBvYrYihAJbwiQ","title":"Everyone should be here: it’s better to be connected.","bodyText":"### Prompt\n\n“There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented, and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.” - Mark Zuckerberg, 2012, Facebook filing for IPO.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, once declared that Facebook was built to accomplish the social mission of making the world more open and connected. This idea that the world should be more connected is a normative expression that is fundamental to the creation of the internet and the web built upon it. But what does the acceptance of this idea also work to produce?\n\n### My Response\n\n\nZuckerberg's letter for Facebook's IPO speaks towards an idealistic view of connectivity on the web as a social good - it makes sense, as it's literally a call for others to financially invest in Facebook. As he speaks towards getting the world connected on Facebook, he packs in idealistic claims about the effects of such, making (unrealistic) assumptions about the best of human behavior.\n\n__Having a voice =/= Having Power__\n\nA main point of conflict in Zuckerberg's letter is equating having a voice on the internet with having political power. Zuck invisions the internet as should resembling <i>\"a network built from the bottom up or peer-to-peer, rather than the monolithic, top-down structure that has existed to date\", and writes about this structure as being able to catalyze social and structural change.</i>\n\n<i>“We believe building tools to help people share can bring a more honest and transparent dialogue around government that could lead to more direct empowerment of people, more accountability for officials and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time.\n\nBy giving people the power to share, we are starting to see people make their voices heard on a different scale from what has historically been possible. These voices will increase in number and volume. They cannot be ignored. Over time, we expect governments will become more responsive to issues and concerns raised directly by all their people rather than through intermediaries controlled by a select few.”</i>\n\nHowever, what's ensuring that governments will care to respond about the issues voiced by the people, and that having this voice gives people tangible power? In \"The Tyranny of Structurelessness\", Jo Freeman speaks about the illusion that structureless, non-hierarchical communities can work towards political action, particularly in the women's rights movement. Freeman explains how almost always, communities that seem structureless are actually covertly run by an elite, given power because of pre-existing factors, like their social backgrounds. (I think this also relates to a sub-myth: that having a voice on the internet is a meritocracy).\n\nFreeman's analysis of the women's movement would debunk Zuckerberg's claims that giving everyone a place to speak online necessarily will result in social change. Everyone having a platform to say things does not mean everyone has a seat at the table where decisions are being made, and voicing an opinion doesn't mean it will get the attention from the leader that needs to hear it.\n\n__Diverse user =/= Diverse Creators__\n\nAnother main implication that Zuck's getting at when he says it's a univeral good that everyone's connected, is the implication that having diverse users of technology results in technology serving them better.\n\n<i>“As people share more, they have access to more opinions from the people they trust about the products and services they use. This makes it easier to discover the best products and improve the quality and efficiency of their lives....\nOne result of making it easier to find better products is that businesses will be rewarded for building better products — ones that are personalized and designed around people. We have found that products that are “social by design” tend to be more engaging than their traditional counterparts, and we look forward to seeing more of the world’s products move in this direction.”</i> - Zuck\n\nThis is a highly optimistic account of the landscape that businesses have on social media, in today's age of surveillance capitalism and targeted ads. Zuck is just too optimistic that businesses are all thinking in the best interests of people on the web.\n\nI think that this statement of his has been true to some extent, and has allowed for the growth of a lot of direct-to-consumer brands that were born from the internet. I think it's nice that you can get bras from stylish, smaller companies that are not Victoria's Secret.\n\nBut a lot of times there isn't a one-to-one business opportunity of designing things that can serve for diversity. In Mukherjee's article, \"I can Text you a Pile of Poo, But I Can't Write my Name\" it's clear that having diverse users doesn't mean technology will be designed to accomodate them. This seems to be the case that these relationships between what users need and what creators of technology offer is so constrained by capitalism. There was probably no business proposition to going in and doing the work to include Bengali letters, so it went ignored.\n\nThe \"Center for Inclusive Design Report\" further complicates the discussion of how users can truly influence the inclusivity of technology. The report advocates for design processes that closely involve underserved populations. On its first page, opens the report from a very profit-conscious perspective: <i>\"If products and services are designed with unique needs in mind, organisations have the potential to reach four times the number of intended consumers.”</i> And at the end it acknowledges that <i>\"inclusion and accessibility is not guaranteed; a shift, whether behavioural or cultural, needs to take place that supports the successful use of this methodology, with broader leadership and regulation, design principles and the ultimate goals of businesses and governments to support the communities in which they operate.”</i>\n\nThis document reads to me in many different ways. In one way, it provides an outline for a democratic future, where we challenge ourselves to consider broader audiences and serve the needs of marginalized people. On the other hand, it frames this altruism with the incentive of maximizing profits (which, if the goal is to serve marginalized people, maybe they won't be able to afford said designed product). Perhaps this is simply a negotiation in the constraints of living in a capitalist world. As someone who does do some product design, I have learned \"inclusive design\" practices to be an accepted Good, but I also wonder what are the limitations to this mindset? To what extent does \"inclusive design\" act as a stamp of approval on companies, to show that they are doing broad social good?\n\n","createdAt":"2019-11-12T04:15:43.354Z","tags":[{"name":"Computing in Context"}]}},{"node":{"id":"jo67myi6XagOAqZUwon5f","title":"Firewall Analysis","bodyText":"### Prompt\n\nRun your Linux host for several days, with a firewall in place and a public IP address.

In it, he insists that __“Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.”__ Using the readings, write a 400-500 word response to the central idea in Barlow’s declaration.\n\n### My Response\n\nI disagree with Barlow's ideas, at it implies that cyberspace is and should be, free of physical constraints and doesn't concern physical bodies. I think it's a common myth that many people take for granted as truth, and I believe Drucker's theories on Performative Materiality provide a lens from which we can observe how that myth - that the internet is divorced of physical constraints - forms.\n\nDrucker's Performative Materiality is a way we can unnderstand technnology through the effects it has on participants (what it does), shaped by the context and relationships that surround its materiality (what it is). I see the myth of the internet - as a faceless, locationless space -  as formed through the way many user-facing factors come together way to give it that effect through repeated use.\n\nDrucker explains interfaces as a means for observable, material details of a technology to work together to perform some interpretation for a user: \"Interface is a space of affordances and possibilities structured into organization for use. An interface is a set of conditions, structured relations, that allow certain behaviors, actions, readings, events to occur.\"\n\nA lot of examples of how interface affects readings of the internet as faceless and spaceless comes to mind. When we signup for some user accounts, we are given the illusion that we can start as a fresh identity, even though behind the scenes systems are still tracking who we are through what devices we're using and what our other browsing history is. Another example that speaks to this is the processes of reporting content on Facebook. Facebook recently had an [exposeé](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona) on the NDA-bound contractors that are required to sift through disturbing content as part of Facebook's content moderation system. Part of why this news comes off so disturbing, in my opinion, is the perception many people have that disturbing content moderation is handled by algorithms, not people. I think this is a result of how user interface patterns work to establish and reinforce (faulty) narratives of what's going on behind the scenes. We are so used to seeing similar interfaces for other automatic things: the UI for reporting a post kind of looks like muting a post or unfollowing someone, so it makes sense that the human-implications aren't at the forefront of our mind.\n\nI resonate with Barlow's ideas that cyberspace has its own culture, that it connects people of different backgrounds and nationalities in ways never before. I think he is wrong to assume, however, that that cultural creation can be done separate from political implications. In the Experimental Geography piece, Paglen says: \"Experimental geography means practices that take on the production of space in a self-reflexive way, practices that recognize that cultural production and the production of space cannot be separated from each another, and that cultural and intellectual production is a spatial practice.\"\n\nOne statement that Barrow made was indicative of this idea that the two cannot be separated: “Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion.” I think this is true, to the extent that sometimes you are able to escape the law by the power of anonymizing technologies - but at some outside cost that *does* exist in the physical world. The incidents described in the Kansas article are a prime example: hackers might have been able to get away with crimes using an IP address that’s centered in the middle of Kansas, but at the cost of impacting real people who have nothing to do with it. IPs are needed for the internet to function the way it does now, and the fact that they are (imperfectly) related to geographical locations means the internet is political and in the world of bodies and physical space.\n\n","createdAt":"2019-11-05T15:40:46.430Z","tags":[{"name":"Computing in Context"}]}},{"node":{"id":"2UnXeZaFaTXAYswo4TTSD","title":"Packet Sniffing","bodyText":"## __Prompt__\n\nCapture and analyze traffic on your home network while going about your usual network activities. \n\nPresent your results in summary form, using graphical analysis where appropriate.\n\n- How much of your network traffic is inbound?

The second session was a few hours, during the evening of that next day. I captured a second session because my roommate was absent for most of the first, and I wanted to be able to explore the volume of our relative network usages in terms of packets.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, I will refer to these two different sessions as __Session 1__ and __Session 2__.\n\nTo analyze these sessions, I used Wireshark to export them as csv files (the first session's file was 2.42 GB! It took like forever to save it, I was worried Wireshark would crash and I would lose the session). I then wrote a script in Python to parse these, and analyze the most common sources, destinations, protocols, and network devices seen in every packet.\n\n[Link to Python Code](https://gist.github.com/jlliu/6db64e749f4171b4b2e9154c986fa600)\n\n<div class=\"iframely-embed\"><div class=\"iframely-responsive\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\"><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jlliu/6db64e749f4171b4b2e9154c986fa600\" data-iframely-url=\"//cdn.iframe.ly/15A84QC\"></a></div></div><script async src=\"//cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n### Inbound vs. Outbound traffic\n\n\nOn both sessions, I found it pretty surprising how roughly 50:50 incoming and outgoing packets were to my device. \n\nThe way I defined \"inbound\" traffic in my program was any packet where the source was not on my local network, and the destination was a device on my network.\n\nConsequently, \"outbound\" traffic was any packet where the source was a device on my local network, and the destination is a device NOT on my network.\n\nI think if I had defined these just in terms of traffic to/from just my computer, the ratios wouldn't change too drastically, as my device is dramatically the most common source/destination as seen later in this analysis.\n\n__Inbound vs. Outbound traffic on Session 1__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=2118502677&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n\n__Inbound vs. Outbound traffic on Session 2__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=507195934&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n\n### Traffic by protocol\n\nI also kept track of what protocols each packet corresponded to.

Further inspection with a tool called Herbivore led me to discover that the Private IP addresses, 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 were both NETGEAR devices (aka the type of router I have), and 192.168.1.4 and 192.168.1.7 were other devices on my network. I didn't feel like bothering my roommate about what IP they were using, so I checked my phone's wifi settings and confirmed my phone's private IP was the one ending in \"4\".\n\nThe volume of packets that have to do with my machine doesn't surprise me, since Wireshark's job is to keep track of packets it sees through the Wifi card on my computer.\n\n__Traffic by Devices on Session 1__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=2104927395&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n\n__Traffic by Devices on Session 2__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=1670796541&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n\nI was confused to see Herbivore tell me about two NETGEAR devices, but I understand them to be related to the fact that I have an [Orbi](https://www.netgear.com/orbi/), a NETGEAR device that lets us extend Wifi signal in our house. I don't actually know too much about how this works but I believe it's called \"mesh routing\".\n\nI was also a little confused about why I see traffic that has to do with these other devices on the network, like my phone or my roommate's computer, if I am indeed looking at traffic that is picked up by my computer's wifi card.\n\nA quick search brought me to this: https://superuser.com/questions/1276176/why-am-i-seeing-other-computers-traffic-on-wireshark. These pieces of traffic I'm seeing for these other devices are likely multicast packets, packets that are broadcasted to every device from my router. These don't actually have to do with their traffic from browsing, for example.\n\n### Sources and Destinations\n\nLooking at the actual sources and destinations for these two session was not to surprising.\n\nIn __Session 1__, I spent a lot of time listening to music so I could DJ for the first time. This resulted in super long spotify binges. I think this makes sense for the breakdown of the sources: \n\n__20 Most Commmon Sources in Session 1__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=2065263531&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n\nI think it also makes sense that we see fewer outside destinations relative to my computer's in Session 1. I mostly left my computer on in the background while I streamed music, occasionally navigating to new songs in Spotify - so I was in general receiving more packets than I was sending out.\n\nOne question I have is: what is the difference between protocols for streaming music versus video? I noticed that a lot of these Spotify related packets were TCP or TLS (Transport Layer Security) - but in class we said UDP was more common for video streaming services because the integrity of packets isn't as high of a priority. On the other hand, I saw that the packets related to Youtube were in UDP.\n\n\n__20 Most Common Destinations in Session 1__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=641647252&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n\n\nIn __Session 2__, I casually browsed Facebook (see all the Facebook related URLS) while working on programming for this assignment (see img.realpython.net and www.afternerd.com later down).\n\n__20 Most Common Sources in Session 2__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=155261707&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n\nFor Session 2, we see that my computer doesn't as drastically outnumber the other destinations in terms of frequency. I see that www.googleapis.com is pretty close in frequency -- but I'm not clear what exactly that means. I searched through the records to see some packets the googleapis has to do with:\n\n- *\"21840\",\"901.322512\",\"Jackies-MacBook-Pro-8121.local\",\"safebrowsing.googleapis.com\",\"UDP\",\"829\",\"65469  >  443 Len=787\"*\n- *\"22167\",\"915.896944\",\"www.googleapis.com\",\"192.168.1.7\",\"TLSv1.2\",\"129\",\"Application Data\"*\n- *\"24741\",\"1137.026017\",\"www.googleapis.com\",\"Jackies-MacBook-Pro-8121.local\",\"TLSv1.2\",\"345\",\"New Session Ticket, Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Handshake Message\"*\n\nMy guess is that because I'm using Chrome, theres are some extra Google services Chrome bakes in to the background. For example, safebrowsing.googleapis.com has to do with the [ Safebrowsing Google API](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing) which gives us a warning if sites we visit are risky. My hypothesis is that I'm seeing a lot of this in the sources and destinations because the fact that I'm using Chrome.\n\n__20 Most Common Destinations in Session 2__\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"371\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTcF36rVknN0nCtQuOdvii0qZ0_TlKcQAOpDO31W0tXYUrQN27TAOjuxpSMYR57XRIE7A2W-jhJXbP9/pubchart?oid=467945655&amp;format=interactive\"></iframe>\n","createdAt":"2019-10-28T19:17:25.855Z","tags":[{"name":"Understanding Networks"}]}},{"node":{"id":"76FDy1RltCXpCyXSDcwTop","title":"Traceroute Project","bodyText":"## Prompt\n\nTraceroute at least three of the sites you regularly visit: Facebook, gmail, bank, school, etc. Do it from all of the locations you regularly connect from.

I used whois to peer into  Autonomous System and IP addresses to get the organization associated with each, and noted the ones that were most salient.\n\n### To Codecademy.com\n![To Codecademy.com](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/5OZHdl3UcXJh4T9tFM5xph/359749460ee5ba712650951b12136467/To_Codecademy.com.png) \n\n### To facebook.com \n![To facebook.com](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/3y7O3AvJbCEukiuonfY22z/d02b0471e6d76727e7584f195c54b60c/To_facebook.com.png)\n\n### To my yoga studio's website\n![To *****yoga.com](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/01frbTAXuMN4FGgCmTkbZP/ae1e4cb91082be56a4a4df5079ccca73/To_stantonstreetyoga.com_.png)\n\n#### Identify who the major tier 1 providers are in your life.\n\nI highlighted the Tier 1 Providers with a pink border - but before I did that, I first looked up what a Tier 1 Provider is. According to my [sources](https://datapath.io/resources/blog/what-is-an-internet-service-provider/), Tier 1 providers are the major ISPs that exchange traffic with other Tier 1 providers. They make up the backbone of the internet, and are the ones responsible for creating infrustructure like submarine cables that bring connectivity across different contents. Wikipedia has a pretty thorough [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network) of recognized Tier 1 providers, so I referenced that as I went through my maps. The providers that came up were:\n\n__GTT Communications Inc.:__ Also showed up as Tiscali International / Tinet\n\n__Verizon:__  Also showed up as Cellco Partnership, ANS Communications, MCI Communications\n\n__CenturyLink:__ Also showed up as Qwest, LEVEL3,\n\n__Tata Commmunications__\n\nMy immediate reaction to doing this is surprise (but also not really surprise) about how many different names one company/organization has! I guess it really speaks to the messy histories of acquisition and merging these network companies undergo.\n\n#### Networks that my traffic crosses\n\nThe graphs show that my day-to-day internet traffic goes through three main streams:\n\n1. The (various) Autonomous System associated with Spectrum (Charter Communications Inc), which is the internet service I use at my apartment.\n2. The AS associated with NYU, provided by NeuStar, Inc, when I use the internet from school.\n3. The many AS's that comprise Verizon, which all have various different names under traceroute, when I use my mobile phone.\n\nFor the most part, going to websites from the three locations result in pretty distinct traceroute paths that converge at the last or second to last AS. \n\nOne exception is the traceroute to my yoga studio, where the paths between tracerouting from home and NYU overlap on Tata Communicatioons and CenturyLink, before heading into \"Ace Data Centers\" and \"Charter Communications\" (Spectrum). \n\nI have an inkling that's because the yoga studio website is more esoteric than the other websites (codecademy.com / facebook) which have millions of users, and you need to go through certain Tier 1 providers (aka the ones that have overlap) in order to access it. \n\nMeanwhile, tracerouting from my devices to other websites leads to pretty unoverlapping paths because each finds their own Tier 1 provider (maybe the one that appears most promising?) that eventually link to the final AS, because the other AS is prominent enough for them to all know about. Facebook is in its own servers, and Codecademy is on Cloudflare servers.\n\n### Explaining a Protocol\n\nDuring my research for this process, I came along several protocols that relate to Autonomous Systems. I found a document from 1996 called [\"Guidelines for creation, selection, and registration of an Autonomous System (AS)\"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1930) helpful in introducing some of these protocols. This document explains that AS's have IGPs (Interior Gateway Protocols) that prescribe how routers within a given AS communicate with each other.\n\nLooking further, I understood IGPs to be a category of protocols. One of them, according to this networks [website](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/IGP) is Open Shortest Path First  (OSPF) protocol.\n\n#### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol:\n\nAn Autonomous System (AS), by definition, is a cluster of networks that uses special protocols called (IGPs) describing how routers within it communicate with each other. One type of IGP that an AS can use is called the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol. OSPF is a way for routers in an AS to respond to changes in a network and store the fastest way to get to any given destination in the network.\n\nThe way OSPF works is that when a network is created or is changed, routers advertise out which routers they're connected to, until all routers in the network have this information. Then, each one uses an algorithm to calculate the shortest path to each destination, taking into account how costly it is to travel through that path. OSPF thus allows information to pass more efficiently through an Autonomous System by having all routers know the best path to destinations. If you work for a large company with their own network, you might notice that they use OSPF which is common in enterprise settings for its efficiency.\n\nFor more information, check out [ this resource ](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/7039-1.html) or the source [documentation](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt) for OSPFs.\n","createdAt":"2019-10-01T00:02:55.787Z","tags":[{"name":"Understanding Networks"}]}},{"node":{"id":"1nFBYlZms4bAP6wxQjMP7s","title":"Merging Genres into a Song","bodyText":"## Prompt\n\nCreate a 2-3 minute long track that merges at least two different genres of music together into one composition.

This film is set in the Middle Ages, has a lot of psychedelically-influenced visuals and music, and is about a woman who discovers sexual liberation and is consequently persecuted as a witch. I'm drawn to the soundtrack because of its really passionate, sensual vocals, and also the historical interest of being created in 1970s Japan.\n\nI guess I was interested in merging it with some more modern genres, that also shared similar sensual undertones. I chose to pair it with the Maria's cover of Baby One More Time (which I guess would be classified as an indie cover of a 2000s Pop song), which was also in a Minor key and carries the same sensual, melancholy, breathy vibes that Belladonna of Sadness does.\n\n## Process\n\nI created this in Garageband. Despite wanting to explore Ableton, I struggled a lot with trying to learn it and ended up using a more user-friendly music program (albeit it was my first time using Garageband also...). \n\nI slowed down the Maria's song to the tempo of Belladonna of Sadness, and also pitch shifted them to be in the same key.\n\nI added some custom musical elements via the instruments to layer on top of the two sampled tracks.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-25 at 4.41.42 PM](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/dyB5giXBA1db2WKmno9ni/b6a406014fdd2671895cb66f0a3916ed/Screen_Shot_2019-09-25_at_4.41.42_PM.png)\n\n","createdAt":"2019-09-25T21:31:05.332Z","tags":[{"name":"Designing Club Cultures"}]}},{"node":{"id":"2ydReXRD53tjkhxhrmx7Of","title":"Designing a Speculative Tour Poster","bodyText":"## The Prompt\n\nCreate a speculative concert/tour poster for a music artist of your choosing.\n\n## My Chosen Artist\n\nI decided to choose Rina Sawayama for my artist of choice. She is a Japanese-English singer-songwriter who has recently come out as pansexual, and has become sort of an icon of representation for queer Asian women who grow up in Western societies like in the UK or the US. \nTo me, as someone who falls into this demographic, I find Rina and the culture of music she creates fascinating as a way to rewrite our representation in a world that previously has not made room for it. The sound of her music resembles that of early 2000s pop (think Britney Spears and NSync), and she repurposes it with messages about queerness, politics, and technology. A lot of the aesthetics around her music, the merch, and the graphic design also borrow the cyberpunk, turn-of-the-century visual elements from this time period.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ORDINARY SUPERSTAR TOUR<br><br>TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW: <a href=\"https://t.co/hdPwDtGneR\">https://t.co/hdPwDtGneR</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/q0l8XWt64u\">pic.twitter.com/q0l8XWt64u</a></p>&mdash; RINA SAWAYAMA 🏳️‍🌈🇯🇵 (@rinasawayama) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rinasawayama/status/1005149831281758209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MERCH DROP 7PM GMT TUESDAY 10TH<br><br>RINA mini album vinyl - exclusive to the online shop<br>ALTERLIFE T shirts orange and white - last EVER run<br>Cyber Rina POPSOCKETS (new!!)<br><br>SHIPPING WORLDWIDE <a href=\"https://t.co/k2MuVkEt9m\">https://t.co/k2MuVkEt9m</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zX0JT8aibk\">pic.twitter.com/zX0JT8aibk</a></p>&mdash; RINA SAWAYAMA 🏳️‍🌈🇯🇵 (@rinasawayama) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rinasawayama/status/1015577599249174528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 7, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nWhen I grew up, Britney Spears was the first real music artist that I was aware of. I didn't really know of any big musical artists in the US who were Asian, and who looked like I did. I think for me, the appeal of Rina Sawayama's music and the visual culture around it is that it reimagines what it would be like if Asian Americans did grow up with pop stars as big as Britney Spears, who looked the way we did. The 2000s aesthetics is a way to transport us back into that time and write in that missing history.\n\n## My \"Tour Poster\"\n\nRina Sawayama's visual aesthetic is already pretty distinct, and I wanted to use the spirit of her style -  which channels early 2000s graphic design and elements of collective childhood nostalgia - to create an interpretation of my own.\n\n![Tour poster](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2uK81ZbWNG2cHslmM5Jh7O/32752b3a4e235bab0d5d5f03d1bec524/Tour_poster.png)\n\n\n### Type Choices\n\nI used a [Powerpuff Girls Font](https://www.dafont.com/powerpuff-girls.font) for the heading, because that personally captures an era of nostalgia and early 2000s aesthetics. I grew up watching Powerpuff Girls as a very young child - about the same time I became conscious of what Pop Music was. I also think the feminist undertones of the cartoon are really fitting for Sawayama's aesthetic.\n\nI also used a free font called [Magenta](https://www.dafont.com/magenta.font) that I felt captured a cyber, 2000s look.\n\n### \"3D Graphics\" \nI wanted to explore blobby, CGI aesthetics that were often used in graphic design during this time period. For this I used a tool called [Sculpt GL](https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/), which easily allows you to sculpt a 3D object within the browser and add an image as a texture. My 3D knowledge is not the most elaborated at this point of my life, so I opted to use a quick tool as opposed to a more elaborate one. I screenshotted results from this online tool and photoshopped them to work within a poster.\n\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-18 at 3.36.56 PM](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/CicTahsnKyzgmTg9C8DNr/8ce8caa98ff63e90c8ab9d2b063900f5/Screen_Shot_2019-09-18_at_3.36.56_PM.png)\n\n### Other notes \n\n- I used a Matrix-like background and changed the colors - I definitely think the Matrix aesthetic is coming back into today's graphic design. I think there are also questions there about how repurposing those visuals can possibly ask questions about equality and representation in the \"hacker\" subculture.\n- I included some cherry blossoms to allude to Sawayama's coming out song, [Cherry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn5YFnrD1u8).\n- Unfortunately I got a bit lazy with the tour dates/cities and ended up copy and pasting repeated cities, so that's something I could go back and refine if I really wanted this to be a high-fidelity tour poster.\n- The image of Rina is from here: http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/eight-pop-stars-to-stan-in-2019/175545/attachment/rina-sawayama\n\n","createdAt":"2019-09-18T19:49:55.295Z","tags":[{"name":"Designing Club Cultures"}]}},{"node":{"id":"5grWCuO749y6uphDAyU6KV","title":"Creating my own song-inspired \"Niche Memes\"","bodyText":"## Prompt\nCreate 3 different sculptures (physical and/or digital) based off 3 different songs in this playlist.

Gen-Z culture is really otherworldly to me, as someone who is barely on the cusp of being categorized as Gen-Z.\n\n2.  I’m interested in how this kind of teen subculture (that’s enabled by the internet, in particular Instagram) relates to broader ideas of subculture. Is there any degree of resistance or empowerment in this? What are the identities of the teens who are making these, across race and class and sexual orientations? Is there any relationship between the consumerism of these (a lot of them include collages of popular makeup products and fashionable clothes) and the privilege of the teens who are making these collages?\n\nSome of them make aesthetic collages around certain time periods, like here for example. There is a degree of stereotyping and imagination in these: after all, they’re what someone born likely after the year 2000 imagines about eras long before they were alive.\n\nWhat does it look for me to make my own Niche Memes about these 3 chosen songs from this weeks prompt?

He laid down a gauntlet, you know, he said, 'Are you prepared to be free?'\"\n\n-https://www.npr.org/2000/09/18/1088122/jimi-hendrix-purple-haze\n\n![IMG B855C23E6563-1](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/4W7QnWdrYlH3YiJPPAJbNY/c9365c4b69a90b0a4684cf0b1ab5e73f/IMG_B855C23E6563-1.jpeg)\n*I Feel Love - Donna Summer*\n\n“She became known as the Queen of Disco“...\n\n-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Summer\n\n![IMG 8F462244A09B-1](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/420cKKJ7DE6FxHjvjV48Gy/aa9488a1978ac1a8f324a4ea033b2fa2/IMG_8F462244A09B-1.jpeg)\n*I'd love to Change the World - Ten Years After*\n\n“\"if there is a single song that can describe the overall vibe of the counterculture in 1969/1970, this may very well be it.“ ...It discusses the confused state of the world, covering a wide variety of societal complaints, until it finally addresses the Vietnam War. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27d_Love_to_Change_the_World\n\n## Reflection\n\nObviously I don’t have as much craft (and time on my hand as some of these teens), so these images aren’t as robust as I’d like them to be. (presumably) Like many of these teens, I also don’t have a strong working knowledge of these specific eras and cultural movements, so I did a little rudimentary research on each of these songs and artists to explore what were the context of these pieces.\n\nSources / Research\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2000/09/18/1088122/jimi-hendrix-purple-haze\n\n+ wikipedia","createdAt":"2019-09-13T21:40:08.216Z","tags":[{"name":"Designing Club Cultures"}]}}]},"tags":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Computing in Context"}},{"node":{"name":"Understanding Networks"}},{"node":{"name":"Designing Club Cultures"}}]}},"context":{}}
