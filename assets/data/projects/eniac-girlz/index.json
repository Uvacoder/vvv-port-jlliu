The ENIAC Girls were the women assigned to work with ENIAC in the 1940s. They became the first computer programmers and tackled novel, never-before-seen problems.\n\nHowever, their contributions were written out of history, and their story is situated in a larger trend of computing fields systematically pushing out women, and of professional fields systematically undervaluing women's work. \n\nBefore electronic computers, large-scale mathematical calculations were done on paper by women \"computers\". The women who were eventually tasked to program the ENIAC were recruited because programming - as the successor to human computing - was also seen as rote, clerical, and less intellectual than where the \"real work\" was (in electronics and hardware).\n\n### Efforts today to (re)introduce women & girls into computing\n\nToday, many companies work towards and fund efforts to get girls (back) into computing through toys, education, and scholarships - hoping to address issues of workplace diversity through pipeline initiatives.\n\nWhile these movements have certainly built community, worked to give more girls educational access, and brought in more young women into technology jobs, what more can we do to ensure dominant cultures and institutions around tech change for the better? How might we reconcile these diversity efforts with the fact that many institutions still repeat histories of writing out women's contributions, undervaluing women's work, and silencing women who speak out against injustice?\n\nENIAC Girlz is an exploration of (but not necessarily an answer to) these questions. By hinting towards some of the cracks in today's efforts, I hope to get others to consider opportunities to make deeper transformations into computing culture and equity.","title":"ENIAC Girlz","coverphoto":"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/4vMeiwsjiT9u6yRy0YjLdj/68de970675f12b3a87f82eff43e22689/child-coloring-cropped.jpg","timePeriod":"Spring 2019","workType":"Speculative design"}}
