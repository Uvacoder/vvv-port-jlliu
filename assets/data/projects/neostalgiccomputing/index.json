Through a speculative design process, students will reflect on their relationships with computing technologies and reimagine them from a hyper-personal, retrospective, and healing lens.\n\n> Many of us are nostalgic about the technology of our pasts, but what happens when we move from nostalgia—longing for what was—to *neo*stalgia—longing for what could have been?\n\nExpanding upon the themes I explored in [Jackie's OS](https://jackieis.online/projects/jackiesos/ \"Jackie's OS project page\"), this course is an experiment in fostering alternate visions of computing culture through self-reflection and speculative play.\n\nThe first cohort begins February 2021. Stay tuned to learn more!\n","title":"Neostalgic Computing","coverphoto":"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1mKTq5ICG0PYxLGzKB0mbH/da5cb82e45192f79513b86b7fc5d9fa9/portfolioCover.png","timePeriod":"Winter 2021","workType":"Course / Curriculum"}}
