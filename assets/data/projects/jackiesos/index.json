My work on Jackie's OS is ongoing - check back for future updates to my project and more writing on my design process!\n\n### Relevant Links\n- <a href=\"http://jackies.world\" target=\"_blank\">Jackie's OS</a>, the web experience.\n- My original <a href=\"https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2020/students/jackie-liu\" target=\"_blank\">thesis documentation</a> on the ITP Thesis 2020 site.\n- My <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/422673732\" target=\"_blank\">thesis presentation video</a> on Vimeo.\n\n---\n\n### About Jackie's OS\n\nOver my life, I’ve transitioned from a starry-eyed child fascinated by technology, to an adult disillusioned by her experiences in it. I’ve also begun to notice the dominant values that echo my social and technical worlds: I must be rational and productive, work to prove my value, quieten my emotions.\n\nAdulthood forces me to unpack some of these beliefs, but as I navigate a career in technology — how do I continue forward? How can I reconcile with ideologies still so ingrained in computing culture? What can it look like to refigure my personal relationship with computing, by going back to its roots?\n\n> How can I speculatively reimagine my childhood experience of computing, and what might I learn from the process?\n\nMy response to these questions is <i>Jackie’s OS</i>: a speculative reimagining of my childhood computer that dreams about an alternate timeline of my formative, (twee)n years in the mid-2000s.\n\n<video autoplay loop>\n  <source src=\"//videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/5jhTbwP4rZBRDtgwoGOfKs/60b9f71451fb367289c9521f1d76ea0e/login_intro_smalller.mp4\"  type=\"video/mp4\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\nDrawing from research of computing systems as echoing patriarchal, hegemonic values about intelligence, productivity, and control, I ask: what if my computer could embody values I wish I could’ve seen? That I have value the way I am, deserve to have space for emotions, and have agency on my own terms?\n\n![Design Principles of Jackie's OS](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1dwibnoXHHFYN0eGeRVQKe/4d903e83c006980e6ab77a768c111290/design_principles.png)\n\nThese values are the core design principles in Jackie’s OS and its reimagined graphical user interface, file system, user authentication, and applications. In a simulated, web-based operating system, visitors can encounter the alternate-reality world of my past self by clicking around the interface, exploring my things, and playing with applications - all designed in my whimsical, childhood imaginary. <br> <br>\n\n![Map of Jackie's OS](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1ARi7rVCnItAxFJJEamhhT/4e7e41759397c5a5791f66924231e96b/Site_Map.png)\n\n<p class=\"caption\">A map of interactive applications in Jackie's OS.</p> \n\n### Tour of Jackie's OS\n\n<div class=\"grid-container no-margin\">\n\n  <p class=\"whole\">In designing and building features for my OS, I kept these core design principles in mind, drawing from my own experiences to find opportunities for how they might playfully manifest in an operating system.</p>\n\n<img class=\"half\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1iTSfyHcvhvgxOdaud2Khw/03522a4eafbeeba7c9b1927120c3db10/the-bedroom.png\" />\n<div class=\"half\"><h4>The Bedroom</h4>\n    <p>Learning that the original computer desktop design and its office metaphor comes from historical values of capitalist productivity, I wanted my OS to instead be a place for rest and dreaming - so I set it in a bedroom!</p>\n  </div>\n\n<img class=\"half\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1oQY8p8UCttFZB18Ud8AP2/07f808689940717bb8b15946f16fb5b7/No_windows.png\" />\n<div class=\"half\"><h4>No windows, no problem!</h4>\n<p>I also learned that windows in the graphical user interface (GUI) are linked to multitasking and productivity, so I chose to not use windows in my interface paradigm.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<img class=\"half\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1hXpQd3z5MqWRy2VEJ9hWb/dde31f686f8a660cdd7cb978589865d4/My_Thingz.png\" />\n<div class=\"half\"><h4>My Thingz</h4>\n<p>An alternate “file explorer” that doesn’t rely on the office metaphor, and offers an intersectional format of organizing “things” on the computer, rejecting singular categorization.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<img class=\"half\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/0rVNKI0SeUPmnhv23WwP7/0489afe13b87dc2dc8b4018ce9e85967/Secret_Authentication.png\" />\n<div class=\"half\"><h4>(Intimately) Personal Authentication</h4>\n<p>A system to access “secret” items by answering a trivia question about me - embodying a relationship about discovery and trust, rather than one of control and dominance.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<img class=\"half\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1DoMhYc0a0cdSeTxgj4ei4/d29b119eceb3275f32be94bf43370332/Cloud_Explorer.png\" />\n<div class=\"half\"><h4>Cloud Explorer</h4>\n<p>A web browser featuring an embedded code editor, that displays the website I <i>would have</i> had - if technical tools for creativity on the web were more accessible to me as a child.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<img class=\"half\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2lzHIrCDnu6ICNkXZNpyeF/08e7a95726518d477c15f5fdaec48b6d/Sketchbook.png\" />\n<div class=\"half\"><h4>My Sketchbook</h4>\n<p>A main application for creating on Jackie’s OS.

I also build upon the work of other educators, such as Laine Nooney and Tega Brain's “Speculative Pasts” pedagogy, which experiments with speculative design’s potential for historical thinking about computing technology.\n\n![Influences](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2YCR58Ob5HK1JOXhfFrtHI/0c3179c9d256dc47f40256af7dec9024/Influences.png)\n\nVisually, I was inspired by the aesthetics of the web designs, virtual worlds, and games of my childhood in the mid-2000s.\n\n### Design Process (coming soon!)\n\nSo far I’ve written about my motivations for Jackie's OS - but if you're curious about a deeper dive into how I designed and built it, stay tuned for a case study coming soon!\n\n### Thesis Presentation Video\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/422673732?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>\n\n### Future Work\n\n> Nostalgia, in my view, is not always retrospective; it can be prospective as well. The fantasies of the past, determined by the needs of the present, have a direct impact on the realities of the future.\n\n<p class=\"quote-source\">Svetlana Boym, quoted in William Kurlinkus' Nostalgic Design.</p>\n\nWhile <i>Jackie’s OS</i> itself is a playful exploration specific to <i>my</i> own experiences, it is also my starting point to help democratize creative and critical engagement in technology.\n\nI am interested in asking: what could it mean to get others to reimagine technologies for themselves, from a place of care and healing?\n\n- To dream of alternatives to our current (and historical) sociotechnical realities, questioning “universal” paradigms?\n- To self-reflect, understanding how our lived, social experiences entangle with systems of harm in technology?\n- To look to the past, using nostalgia as both a lens to acknowledge what we have lost and to reconcile with how things could have been, and could be, better?\n\nI hope to extend this prompt as an educational tool in the form of workshops, zines, or web experiences. Through this work, I hope to create lower-barrier tools that broaden participation in speculative futures (and pasts), pushing beyond the traditional contexts of speculative critical design and nurturing an ethos of care within mainstream computing education and culture.\n\nIf you’re a curator/educator who would like to collaborate as I bring these ideas to life, don’t hesitate to get in touch!\n","title":"Jackie's OS","coverphoto":"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/5lgPPerSo369hTbrApEUCB/6e6866d2901ac53dab8276d1a79fd496/Hero_Header_Image_-_1436x808.png","timePeriod":"Spring 2020","workType":"Speculative design / Net art"}}
