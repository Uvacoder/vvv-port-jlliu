When applied, they can do things such as generate \"random\" text, as long as you feed the model some text it can observe.\n\nThis Fall, I took an Information Design class that allowed us to choose any dataset for exploration. While I could have chosen some more pragmatic topic, I chose to take a more conceptual approach by designing a representation for a very personal dataset - i.e., my entire body of online conversations with an ex, conveniently recorded by Facebook. As opposed of finding a way to inform of details of the relationship very transparently, I was interested in using Markov chains to rearrange our conversations into a new narrative.\n\n<div class=\"grid-container\">\n  \n<img v-scroll-reveal class=\"third\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/GykJwf3tvHvpITCHSnKGq/cbcb16635e3fce3d6cdfbfbb4db0a13e/lovenotes-mockup1.png\" />\n  \n<img v-scroll-reveal class=\"third\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1n49TU0VChPuYicMUmBaL8/e4a99e0e5b48bce877a95a7a1a8f2066/lovenotes-mockup2.png\" />\n  \n<img v-scroll-reveal class=\"third\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/3iZ4tYSrzSV94Mlt5Q3Hd8/4662160c0ed9868f98155d7bc07496f6/lovenotes-mockup3.png\" />\n  \n</div>\n \nPartially inspired by the visual interface design in Spike Jones' Her, my initial conceptual sketches envisioned a web interface that would cycle through generated notes, that I'd handwrite, in a gallery format.\n\n\n## creating the notes\n\nGenerating notes first starts with data collection - I used a Facebook message downloader extension to download the data and fed each message into Markov models with help from a handy python-based generator.\n\nEach model is created based on its own body of sample text; in the end I decided to group the conversation by different characteristic stages in our relationship and feed each group into its own Markov model. The most interesting, funny, and poignant phrases made it to the final visualization.\n\nSince the generated phrases often combine fragments of two or more unrelated pieces of conversation, I built upon the visual metaphor of handwritten stationary and imagined the phrases as if our online conversations existed as physical letters that were cut and pasted together to make a different story.\n\n<div class=\"grid-container\">\n\n  <img v-scroll-reveal class=\"third\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1UfqiD1dls7ZNTeAiV1Rtl/9a8bde4b9bdf19e5ca52b0e3b4439384/lovenotes-gallery.png\" />\n  \n  <img v-scroll-reveal class=\"third\" src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/7AVWCLoEFItPthMlg7vZcU/b5bb8f48fa778d7378e099996af691bd/lovenotes-gallery2.png\" />\n  \n</div>\n\n\nThe final notes made it into a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based carousel image gallery, which guides the audience through the curated story.\n\n## interactivity\n\nTo explore the idea of deconstructing and reconstructing stories from these notes, I added interactive features that would allow users to drag around, piece together, and decorate the love notes as they saw fit. These features sit in an edit pane that appears after the user begins to explore the different notes.\n\n<div class=\"grid-container\">\n\n<p class=\"half\">\nThe note pieces are draggable with help from a jQuery library, and can be mixed and matched with any other pieces.
